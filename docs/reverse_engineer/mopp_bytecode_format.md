# Havok 5.5 MOPP bytecode format — decoded & proven

**Scope:** the on-disk `hkpMoppCode` MOPP (Memory-Optimized Partial Polytope) bytecode — the compressed
spatial BV-tree that accelerates static-world collision ([`terrain_collision_regeneration.md`](terrain_collision_regeneration.md)).
This is the format a **native Rust MOPP compiler** must emit to regenerate collision for new geometry
without the HCT/DCC toolchain (walled — see memory `mopp-bake-oracle-hct-recipe`). **Status:** decoder
PROVEN; split-plane geometry PROVEN (see "Split geometry"); encoder is **spatially conservative** and
geometry-gated (`query_aabb` no-miss on synthetic + real meshes, FindAll + leaf-box gates on 43 real
`vz.wad` MOPPs). Upgrades the long-standing "recognised, not decoded" note in
[`physics_code_map.md`](physics_code_map.md) §2.

## How it was proven
Decompiled the 14 functions in `hctFilterPhysics.dll` that reference the validator string *"Unknown
command – This mopp data has been corrupted…"* (`.\Collide\Mopp\Machine\hkpMoppObbVirtualMachine.cpp`).
Three independent VM variants — `FUN_10081890` (OBB query), `FUN_100a4630` (early-exit OBB), `FUN_100a59d0`
(KDop) — share **one identical instruction encoding**; that switch statement *is* the instruction set. A
decoder mirroring it (geometry tests stripped, FindAll semantics: visit every node, emit every leaf) walks
the real reference MOPP with **901/901 bytes consumed, 0 errors, 76 distinct contiguous shape-keys [0..76]**
(only key 32 absent). Deliverables archived at `Temp\hunt\mopp\{mopp_decode.rs,decode.py,phys_moppvm.txt,progress.md}`.

## `hkpMoppCode` struct + quantization (PROVEN)
```
hkpMoppCode : hkReferencedObject { CodeInfo m_info; hkArray<hkUint8> m_data; hkInt8 m_buildType; }
CodeInfo m_info = one hkVector4 m_offset = [offset.x, offset.y, offset.z, 1/scale]   // lane 3 = RECIPROCAL
```
- **On-disk layout (PC 32-bit, PROVEN):** for the serialized `hkpMoppCode` object, `m_info` sits at
  `obj+16` (offset.xyz @ `+16/+20/+24`, lane 3 @ `+28`); the `m_data` hkArray follows at `obj+32`
  (`ptr @ +32`, `count @ +36`, `capAndFlags @ +40`); `m_buildType` at `+44`.
- **Dequant:** `world_coord = int_coord * scale + offset`, where **`scale = 1.0 / m_info.lane3`**.
  Measured on retail `vz.wad`, lane 3 holds `~1e6`–`2e6` (e.g. `2 280 380` for a ~30 m cell) — far too
  large to be a world-per-unit step; its reciprocal (`~4.4e-7`) is the sane per-integer-unit scale for a
  ~24-bit frame, and matches the VM's `realCoord = intCoord * this[0x10]` multiply (`this[0x10]` = the
  cached `1/lane3`). *(Earlier note said lane 3 = scale directly — corrected: it is `1/scale`.)*
- Integer coords are hierarchical: `int = (operand << shift) + origin[axis]`. The formula is
  `shift = 0x10 - m_info.p3root` (VM `FUN_100a59d0` uses `0x10 - param_1[3]`; OBB `FUN_10081890` stores it
  directly in `param_1[5]`). **★ MEASURED 2026-08-16 — the ROOT shift is a FIXED `16` (`p3root = 0`).**
  Retail-oracle sweep (`mopp.rs::diag_retail_floor_root_shift_oracle`): each of floor `0x39AF17DC`'s 4 baked
  MOPPs, with FOUR DIFFERENT `m_info` scales (5.0e-7 … 2.1e-6), is no-miss over its OWN real triangles at
  shift 16 and ONLY 16; every other shift misses ~all triangles. So the shift is constant, and the *scale*
  is what varies: Havok bakes each mesh's `scale = ext_max / 0xFF0000` (a 24-bit frame — byte operand `0xFF`
  → int `0xFF0000`), so the far face maps to operand `0xFF` at shift 16. *(Corrects the earlier speculation
  that `p3root` varies with mesh size / that a ~30 m cell needs shift ~18 — it does not; it is 16 with a
  finer scale.)* Each REANCHOR (`0x01–0x04`) then does `origin[k] += code[+1+k] << shift; shift -= opcode` —
  refining a child cell BELOW the root's byte resolution. **Coordinate math is NOT needed to recover triangle
  indices** (the decoder ignores it) — but it IS needed for a spatial `query_aabb`/encoder; see below.
- ⚠ `output/_scratch/old_mopp.bin` is only the 901-byte `m_data` buffer (no struct), AND it is the **stale
  u32-scrambled** dump (predates fix `b93e00` by ~4 min). Decode it with `--unreverse` (un-reverse each
  aligned 4-byte word). A MOPP extracted by the *current* `havok.rs` (stores raw u8) decodes with NO unreverse.

## Opcode table (byte → operands → action)
Context carried down each branch: an integer origin/AABB frame, a **shape-key base accumulator**, and a
scale exponent. **Operands are big-endian.** All PROVEN from the VM switch unless marked INFERRED.

**Split child layout:** LEFT child immediately follows the header (inline); RIGHT child at the encoded byte
offset. A split visits both; a terminal / `0x00` ends the branch; CUT / REANCHOR / property ops are unary.

## Split geometry — the plane operands + child-visit rule (PROVEN)
Resolves the earlier "coordinate math INFERRED" note. Ground truth = the VM switch in
`Temp\hunt\mopp\phys_moppvm.txt` (`FUN_10081890` OBB, `FUN_100a59d0` KDop — both agree byte-for-byte).

A MOPP internal node is a **Bounding-Interval-Hierarchy (BIH) split**: two planes on ONE axis, an *inline
(LEFT)* child bounded ABOVE and an *offset (RIGHT)* child bounded BELOW.
- `0x10–0x12`: `Lmax = (code[+1] << shift) + origin[axis]`, `Rmin = (code[+2] << shift) + origin[axis]`
  (both then `* scale + offset` to world). The inline child occupies `[.., Lmax]` on the axis; the offset
  child occupies `[Rmin, ..]`. (KDop: LEFT recursion sets `bound[axis].max = code[+1]`; RIGHT sets
  `bound[axis].min = code[+2]`. OBB: `param_3[axis+4] = code[+1]` for LEFT, a stack temp `= code[+2]`
  becomes RIGHT's min. Identical.)
- `0x20–0x22` compressed: a single `v = code[+1]` → `Lmax = (v+1) << shift`, `Rmin = v << shift` (the two
  planes are one quantum apart — a 1-unit overlap).
- `0x23–0x25`: `code[+1]`/`code[+2]` = `Lmax`/`Rmin` exactly as `0x10–0x12`, with BE16 child offsets.
- CUT `0x26–0x28` sets the running node box **absolutely**: `box.min[axis] = code[+1]`-plane,
  `box.max[axis] = code[+2]`-plane. `0x29–0x2b` uses BE24 **absolute** ints (no `<<shift`, no origin).

**Child-visit rule (the VM's pruning, reduced to an axis-aligned query AABB `[qmin,qmax]`):**
visit the inline child iff `qmin[axis] ≤ Lmax`; visit the offset child iff `qmax[axis] ≥ Rmin`. (The OBB
VM's slab test `FUN_10081890` collapses to exactly this for an axis-aligned query; a CUT prunes the whole
branch when the query is disjoint from the tightened box.) Implemented as `mopp.rs::query_aabb`.

**Conservative encoding (`mopp.rs::encode`).** For each split the inline child's `code[+1]` = its true
max-on-axis rounded UP, and the offset child's `code[+2]` = its true min-on-axis rounded DOWN — so a query
can never miss a boundary triangle. **Root operand shift is `16`** (the measured engine value — see above)
and the frame divides the widest extent by `0xFF0000` (a 24-bit frame) so the AABB-max face maps to
`int = 0xFF0000 = 0xFF<<16`, representable as an upper bound. REANCHOR is not emitted (encoder stays at root
byte precision; finer bounds would need `0x01–0x04`). *(Historically shift `8` / `÷0xFF00`, which was
internally self-consistent but off by 256× vs the engine — the root cause of the authored-floor spatial-MOPP
fall-through, fixed 2026-08-16.)*

**Gates (all green, `cargo test -p mercs2_formats mopp`):**
- NO-MISS: `query_aabb(encode(mesh))` ⊇ brute-force AABB-overlap set over thousands of random queries, on a
  quad, a box, a 2 k random-tri soup, and 5 real `WpMeshShape16` meshes from `vz.wad` — **zero misses**;
  mean over-inclusion 1.0–4.1× (candidates / true overlaps).
- FindAll equivalence: `query_aabb(all-space)` == `decode()` shape-key multiset on **43 real MOPPs** —
  proves the traversal (REANCHOR / JUMP / CUT / 26-DOP) is byte-correct on Havok's own bytecode.
- Leaf-box reachability: on **2 703 real leaf boxes** across 43 MOPPs, a query at each fully-bounded leaf's
  reconstructed box centre returns that leaf — proves the pruning is nesting-correct (no over-prune).

**Resolved 2026-08-16 (was "still open"):** the *absolute* `query_aabb(realMOPP) ⊇ brute-force-over-source-tris`
cross-check that was "BLOCKED by frame alignment" is now green — the blocker was the wrong root shift, not a
mesh-decode issue. At the MEASURED shift `16` (not the old `8`), each of retail floor `0x39AF17DC`'s 4 MOPPs
is no-miss over its own decoded triangles (`mopp.rs::diag_retail_floor_root_shift_oracle` +
`phy2_build.rs::spatial_mopp_no_miss_and_prunes_in_common_frame_if_present`). The 26-DOP diagonal split
plane geometry (`0x13–0x1c`) is still INFERRED; `query_aabb` visits both children unpruned for those
(conservative), and `encode` never emits them.

## Phase-3 encoder plan (we emit our OWN valid tree, not Havok's exact one)
1. Build any BVH over the triangles (median/SAH, axis-aligned).
2. Per node: quantize the split plane into the current integer frame; emit `0x10–0x12` (axis split, 1-byte
   right offset), or `0x23–0x25` (16-bit) when the left subtree exceeds 255 bytes. Recurse LEFT inline, place
   RIGHT at the recorded offset.
3. Leaves as terminals. **MVP-safe:** `0x0b <BE32 tri_index>` then `0x30` (delta 0) per leaf — trivially
   correct absolute keys; optimize to small deltas + `0x09/0x0a` base bumps later.
4. Optional: tighten node AABBs with CUT ops (`0x26–0x28`) for prune performance — not required for correctness.

### Invariants the emitter MUST honor
- Every byte reached at an instruction boundary must be a valid opcode (avoid all INVALID ranges) — else the
  "corrupted" assert fires and the load-time walk can read OOB.
- Child offsets must land exactly on a subtree's first instruction.
- 1-byte right offsets (`0x10–0x22`) cap the left subtree at 255 bytes; use `0x23–0x25` beyond that; jumps
  `0x05–0x07` similarly bounded.
- Node AABBs must **conservatively enclose** all descendant triangles so runtime overlap queries never miss.
- Emit raw little-endian-on-disk u8 (**no u32 swap** — that scramble is what corrupted `old_mopp.bin`).

## Open (non-blocking for an MVP encoder)
- Exact plane geometry of `0x13–0x1c` (26-DOP diagonal splits) — the MVP avoids them (axis splits only).
- Property (`0x60–0x6b`) semantics — application-defined per-terminal metadata; irrelevant to triangle indices.
- Whether absent key 32 is a degenerate-tri cull vs a sibling-shape key — needs the source `WpMeshShape16` tri count.
- `m_info` scale/offset for the specific `old_mopp.bin` sample (the file is only `m_data`).
