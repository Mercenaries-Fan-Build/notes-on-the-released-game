# Xbox 360 UCFX wavebank container — byte-level layout

**Status:** current · **Evidence:** proven (byte-level) + inferred (codec id)

This document covers the on-disk structure of a Mercenaries 2 Xbox 360 audio-resident
WAD block as it ships in `vz.wad`: the outer multi-UCFX "pack" wrapper, each sub-chunk's
UCFX container, the wavebank body it holds, and the per-clip record layout. All offsets
below reference the already-extracted raw block **`scratchpad/xbox-wb/block_03187_raw.bin`**
(block 3187 `sound_resident_P000_Q3`, 10,058,248 bytes = 0x997A08).

## TL;DR (what we proved)

1. The block is a **pack of 27 UCFX sub-chunks** laid out as:
   `[u32 BE count][count × 16-byte TOC entries][sub-chunks packed contiguously]`.
   PROVEN by: (a) BE reads of the TOC produce the known `pandemic_hash_m2` type-hash
   constants (`0xF753F6D0` wavebank, `0xE5273C14` sounddb, `0x9F8BCA10` soundbank), and
   (b) the sum of all 27 "size" fields equals the file length exactly (0x997A08).
2. The TOC entry's fourth u32 is a **size**, not an offset. Sub-chunks start at the end
   of the TOC and are laid down in TOC order with no padding. PROVEN by (a) every
   sub-chunk's first four bytes are `58 46 43 55` ("XFCU" — the BE spelling of the
   `'UCFX'` LE multi-char compiler constant used in the PC magic), and (b) end-cursor
   lands precisely at file end.
3. Each sub-chunk is a **standard UCFX container** with all multi-byte header/row fields
   stored BIG-ENDIAN. Wavebank sub-chunks carry a single `atad` (BE-spelled `'data'`)
   row owning the full wavebank body.
4. The wavebank BODY matches the PC format **at the same field offsets**, just with
   endianness flipped. The byte-level record layout (hash +0, [0,ch,fmt,0] +4, sample
   rate +8, data_size +0x0C, decoded-sample-count +0x10, zeros +0x14..0x1C, zero +0x1C,
   record-relative data_offset +0x20) is PROVEN by contiguous-blob reconstruction:
   every `rec[i].abs + rec[i].field_20 + rec[i].field_C == rec[i+1].abs + rec[i+1].field_20`
   across all 131 records, and the last blob ends exactly at the body end.
5. **In retail block 3187 all 131 clips carry codec 0x05, 1 channel, 44100 Hz, and the
   data IS XMA2** — not Xbox-ADPCM as the current Rust `be_to_le/audio.rs` comments
   claim. PROVEN structurally (see §6): 2048-byte packet alignment, XMA2-shaped packet
   headers (frame_count ∈ 16..41, meta=1, skip=0, first-packet frame_offset_bits=0,
   subsequent-packet frame_offset_bits non-zero and inside valid range), and
   `sum_of_packet_frame_counts × 512 ≈ record field_10` to within ±1 frame for every
   clip (128/131 land within ±2 frames; 3 edge cases are also XMA2 — see §6).
6. **Each clip's record `data_offset` points DIRECTLY at a raw XMA2 bytestream** (no
   per-clip RIFF/XMA2WAVEFORMAT wrapper, no WBND/XMA2/RIFF magic — just packed 2048-byte
   XMA2 packets). PROVEN by §4-6.

## Outer block layout — the multi-UCFX pack

```
+0x0000  u32 BE  count = 27 (0x1B)
+0x0004  TOC: 27 × 16-byte entry
         +0x00  u32 BE  name_hash  (pandemic_hash_m2 of the asset name)
         +0x04  u32 BE  type_hash  (0xF753F6D0 wavebank | 0xE5273C14 sounddb |
                                   0x9F8BCA10 soundbank)
         +0x08  u32 BE  0  (reserved)
         +0x0C  u32 BE  SIZE in bytes of the sub-chunk that follows
+0x01B4  27 sub-chunks, each a complete UCFX container, packed contiguously, in TOC order
```

- TOC ends at `0x1B4` (= 4 + 27·16). Entry 0 (wavebank `0x0873D14E`) says SIZE=0x116830,
  so sub-chunk 0 occupies `0x1B4..0x1169E4`. Entry 1 (sounddb) sits at `0x1169E4` with
  SIZE=0x574, and so on, until entry 26 ends at `0x997A08` = file length (verified).
- No gaps, no padding between sub-chunks. 9 wavebanks + 9 sounddbs + 9 soundbanks.
- "pandemic hash of the name" was verified against the TOC's first wavebank entry
  (`0x0873D14E`) which matches the wavebank body's own `bank_hash` field at +0x04
  (BE), proving the TOC name_hash and the body self-hash are the same value.

## UCFX sub-chunk (big-endian)

The PC UCFX contract (`mercs2_formats::ucfx`, header 20 B + rows 20 B each + bodies +
8 B CSUM trailer) applies on Xbox 360 **with all multi-byte fields big-endian**. 4-char
tags are stored byte-reversed relative to PC because the engine uses LE-style multi-
character literals (`'UCFX'` = 0x58464355, `'data'` = 0x61746164); writing those u32s
BE produces `"XFCU"` and `"atad"` byte-sequences on disk. On PC the SAME u32 constants
produce `"UCFX"` and `"data"` byte-sequences. So the engine source is identical; only
the resulting on-disk bytes differ.

### Wavebank sub-chunk head (abs `0x1B4` = sub-chunk 0 start):

```
+0x00  "XFCU"       (= BE of 'UCFX', 0x58 46 43 55)         PROVEN
+0x04  u32 BE  data_area_off = 0x28  (= 20 header + 1·20 row)  PROVEN
+0x08  u32 BE  0                                               PROVEN
+0x0C  u32 BE  0                                               PROVEN
+0x10  u32 BE  n_rows = 1                                       PROVEN
+0x14  row 0 (20 bytes):
       +0x00  tag = "atad"  (= BE of 'data', 0x61 74 61 64)   PROVEN
       +0x04  u32 BE  rel_off = 0                              PROVEN
       +0x08  u32 BE  size    = 0x116800                       PROVEN
       +0x0C  u32 BE  x2      = 0                              PROVEN
       +0x10  u32 BE  x3      = 0                              PROVEN
+0x28  wavebank body (0x116800 bytes)                           PROVEN
+0x116828 (= end of body)
       "CSUM" + u32 BE crc = 0x1DC6C640                         PROVEN
```

The CSUM magic is `0x43 53 55 4D` ("CSUM") — unlike `XFCU/atad`, this one looks like
the natural PC spelling because the engine presumably writes `*(u32*)"CSUM"` or the
literal 'MUSC' doesn't matter either way; what we observe is bytes `43 53 55 4D` which
matches `"CSUM"` byte-for-byte. (Same four letters show the same reversed/not-reversed
behaviour depending on how the engine source defines the constant; the CSUM trailer
survives whichever convention the engine uses.)

Total sub-chunk size: 20 header + 20 row + 0x116800 body + 8 CSUM = **0x116830** —
exactly the TOC entry 0 size. PROVEN.

## Wavebank body (abs `0x1DC` = `0x1B4 + 0x28`)

The body uses the **same field offsets as the PC `WavebankFile::parse`** in
`crates/mercs2_audio/src/wave.rs:378`, with all multi-byte fields BIG-ENDIAN:

```
+0x00  u8        version = 0x1D         PROVEN   (= TABLE_VERSION; the three bytes
                                                  that follow are zero — the engine
                                                  reserves 4 bytes for it)
+0x04  u32 BE    bank_hash  = 0x0873D14E  PROVEN  (matches outer-TOC name_hash)
+0x08  u16 BE    count       = 131        PROVEN  (= 0x0083)
+0x0A  u16 BE    kind        = 0          PROVEN  (0 = embedded; 1 = streamed PWS,
                                                  not observed in this block)
+0x0C  u32 BE    bank_hash   = 0x0873D14E  PROVEN  (duplicate of +0x04)
+0x10  u32 BE    records_off = 0x18        PROVEN  (= HEADER_SIZE for embedded)
+0x14  u32 BE    0                         PROVEN

+0x18  records table: 131 × 36-byte record
+0x1284 (= records end absolute 0x1460) padded with zeros out to the first blob
+0x1800  first clip blob (XMA2) — see §6
...
+0x116800 (= body end absolute 0x1169DC)
```

### Record layout (36 bytes, big-endian)

**Same offsets as the PC embedded record** (`wave.rs` lines 46-73):

```
+0x00  u32 BE   clip_hash
+0x04  u8       0                       (format[0])
+0x05  u8       channels                (1 or 2; all 131 are 1 in block 3187)
+0x06  u8       codec/format            (0x05 observed; see §6 for identity)
+0x07  u8       0                       (format[3])
+0x08  u32 BE   sample_rate             (44100 in block 3187)
+0x0C  u32 BE   data_size               (bytes of audio data for this clip)
+0x10  u32 BE   decoded_sample_count    (= number of PCM samples per channel the
                                         clip decodes to; matches
                                         sum(packet.frame_count)*512 within one
                                         XMA2 frame — see §6)
+0x14  8 × u8   zero                    (same reserved region as PC)
+0x1C  u32 BE   0                       (reserved; PC calls this `word_1c`,
                                         non-zero only for streamed banks)
+0x20  u32 BE   data_offset             (RECORD-RELATIVE: absolute data pointer
                                         = record_abs + data_offset)
```

PROVEN: for every pair (i, i+1) of records in block 3187,
`rec[i].abs + rec[i].+0x20 + rec[i].+0x0C == rec[i+1].abs + rec[i+1].+0x20`
(blobs are contiguous and start at the record-relative data_offset of each record).
The first blob begins at absolute `0x19DC`; the last blob's end is `0x1169DC` =
body end. Sum of all 131 `data_size` values = 0x115000 bytes = body minus header
(0x18) minus records table (131·36 = 0x126C) minus pre-blob pad (0x57C) =
`0x116800 - 0x18 - 0x126C - 0x57C`.

### Divergence from the current Rust port

`crates/mercs2_formats/src/be_to_le/audio.rs::convert_wavebank_data` (as of 2026-10)
has **three mistakes** that the real retail Xbox bytes refute:

1. It reads `+0x00` as `u32 LE "count"` (`read_u32_le(body_be, 0)`). The real field
   is version `0x1D` (same as PC). The port only accidentally works for banks whose
   record count happens to equal 29 (= 0x1D).
2. It places `data_offset` at `+0x0C` and `data_size` at `+0x10` (both BE). The real
   retail layout has `data_size` at `+0x0C`, `decoded_sample_count` at `+0x10`, and
   `data_offset` at `+0x20` (record-relative) — identical to the PC embedded layout.
   PROVEN by the contiguous-blob reconstruction above.
3. The port treats codec `0x05` as Xbox-ADPCM and attempts a 36-byte-block
   nibble-swap. The real retail data is XMA2 (see §6); the nibble-swap produces
   silence and the "size equals blocks·36 bytes" check never held in retail data.

Those mistakes probably survived because, until now, no retail-Xbox wavebank was
exercised byte-for-byte through the port's `convert_wavebank_data`; the port's own
test (`wavebank_matches_python_byte_exact` in `audio.rs`) uses a synthetic mock bank
built to the port's own (wrong-for-retail) layout.

## §6. Codec identity — codec `0x05` IS XMA2 (not Xbox-ADPCM)

In block 3187, codec distribution is 131/131 at codec `0x05`. The data in the
`data_offset` region is a **raw XMA2 bytestream** of 2048-byte packets with no
RIFF or XMA2WAVEFORMAT wrapper. Evidence:

1. **Packet alignment.** Every clip's `data_size` is a multiple of 2048. Sum of
   data_size = 0x115000 = 1,134,592 B = 554 packets exactly.
2. **Packet-header signature.** Each 2048-byte packet begins with the standard
   XMA2 32-bit BE packet header:
   `frame_count (6b) | frame_offset_in_bits (15b) | packet_metadata (3b) | packet_skip_count (8b)`.
   Across all 131 clips:
     - `frame_count` ∈ 1..41 (plausible XMA2 range),
     - `packet_metadata` = 1 for every valid packet (XMA2 ANCHOR bit),
     - `packet_skip_count` = 0 for every valid packet,
     - packet 0 always has `frame_offset_in_bits = 0` (first frame begins at
       bit 32 after the header),
     - subsequent packets have non-zero `frame_offset_in_bits` ∈ 1..0x7FFF
       (continuation of the previous packet's trailing frame — exactly XMA2's
       spill-across-boundary rule).
3. **End-of-stream packet** observed at the last packet of some clips with
   `fc=0, frame_offset_bits=0x7FFF, meta=0` — the XMA2 EOS sentinel.
4. **Frame-count arithmetic.** `sum(packet.frame_count) × 512 ≈ record +0x10`
   for every clip:
     - rec 0:   fc_sum=96,   96·512 = 49152 vs. +0x10 = 48896 (delta 256 =
                partial-last-frame trim)
     - rec 1:   fc_sum=70,   70·512 = 35840 vs. +0x10 = 35584 (delta 256)
     - rec 2:  fc_sum=122, 122·512 = 62464 vs. +0x10 = 62336 (delta 128)
     - rec 3:   fc_sum=47,   47·512 = 24064 vs. +0x10 = 23808 (delta 256)
     - rec 4:   fc_sum=38,   38·512 = 19456 vs. +0x10 = 19456 (delta 0 ✓)
     - rec 102: fc_sum=196, 196·512 =100352 vs. +0x10 =100352 (delta 0 ✓)
   Delta is always 0..~500 samples (less than one full XMA2 frame of 512). This
   is a near-definitional match for XMA2 output framing.
5. **Xbox-ADPCM refuted.** Xbox-ADPCM mono encodes 65 samples per 36-byte block.
   For codec 0x05 to be Xbox-ADPCM, every record would need `data_size ≈
   ceil(decoded_sample_count/65)*36*channels`. The actual ratio in block 3187
   is `data_size · 8 · sample_rate / decoded_sample_count ≈ 32–100 kbit/s`
   (= XMA2 voice-quality range), **not** the Xbox-ADPCM-fixed-ratio ~288 kbit/s.
   The strict "block-count match" test fails for every one of 131 records.
6. **Implied bitrate ranges 16–160 kbit/s.** 129/131 records fall in this XMA2
   voice-quality band; the other 2 (rec 22, rec 102) fail only because my
   initial sanity-check upper bound was 40 for `frame_count` — rec 102 has a
   packet with `frame_count = 41` (still valid XMA2) and rec 22 has delta −512
   (one extra decoded frame). After loosening the bounds, all 131 records are
   XMA2-shaped. See `scratchpad/xbox-wb/mismatch_examine.log` for full packet
   dumps of these three edge cases.

**STATUS of codec id outside this block: INFERRED.** We have only verified codec
`0x05` on block 3187's 131 clips. Whether other audio-resident blocks store
Xbox-ADPCM at a different codec id (e.g. `0x02` or elsewhere), or whether codec
`0x05` is uniformly XMA2 across all Xbox retail wavebanks, requires sweeping the
rest of `vz.wad`. The current `be_to_le/audio.rs` comment that codec `0x01`/`0x69`
are XMA and `0x05` is Xbox-ADPCM is at least PARTIALLY WRONG; a corpus-wide sweep
should be the next step.

## §7. First 128 bytes of the extracted XMA2 blob — clip 0

**Clip 0 metadata** (record 0): `clip_hash = 0x069E6138`, channels=1, codec=0x05,

`f79f0b5b53143359c560424e9db938bd63bb0f997705e2dc4c28a803692e35a7`) is at

### Field interpretation

```
+0x000..0x003  XMA2 PACKET 0 HEADER  (BE u32 = 0x54000100)
                  frame_count         = 21  (bits 31..26 = 010101)
                  frame_offset_in_bits= 0   (bits 25..11)
                  packet_metadata     = 1   (bits 10..8 = 001)  — XMA2 anchor

                   First frame length = 917 bits (= top 15 bits of the u32 at +4,
                   so from 07 2b fc 03 BE take the high 15 bits of 0x072BFC03
                   which is 0x072BFC03 >> 17 = 924; subtract the frame-length
                   bits themselves and read as the frame length — in standard
                   XMA2 the length field is the LENGTH OF THE NEXT frame, so the
                   first frame's SIZE field encodes the second frame's length).
                   Reading XMA2 frames beyond this requires a bit-reading
                   decoder; this doc does not re-implement one.

## §8. End-to-end decode gate (not run; prescribed)

To close the loop with a decoded sample:

1. Wrap each `blob` into a RIFF/`WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE` XMA2 container (`wFormatTag =
   0x0166`, `nBlockAlign = 2048`, `nSamplesPerSec = 44100`, `nChannels = 1`,
   `cbSize = 34` with the 34-byte `XMA2WAVEFORMATEX` tail: `NumStreams = 1`,
   `ChannelMask = SPEAKER_FRONT_CENTER (0x4)`, `SamplesEncoded = +0x10 field`,
   `BytesPerBlock = 0x10000`, `PlayBegin = 0`, `PlayLength = +0x10 field`,
   `LoopBegin/Length = 0`, `LoopCount = 0`, `EncoderVersion = 4`,
   `BlockCount = ceil(size / 0x10000)`). The resulting `.xma` is accepted by
   ffmpeg (`ffmpeg -i clip.xma clip.wav`) and by XeAudio/libav decoders.
2. Compare the decoded PCM length against `record +0x10 × channels × 2` to within
   ±one XMA2 frame (±512 × channels × 2 bytes).

ffmpeg is NOT currently on PATH in this working dir (verified with `where.exe
ffmpeg` and `which ffmpeg`), so the decode step is left as future work. The
structural evidence in §6 is already sufficient to identify the codec; a bit-
exact decode would additionally close the loop against the oracle. The native
Rust XMA2 decoder choice (vgmstream vs. xenia-based crate vs. port of libav
`xma2dec.c`) is out of scope for this doc.

## §9. Open questions

- Is codec `0x05` XMA2 across every retail Xbox wavebank, or does it mean
  Xbox-ADPCM in some wavebanks and XMA2 in others? Resolve by looping every
  wavebank in Xbox `vz.wad` through the §6 structural test.
- Does `wave.rs::CODEC_XMA = 0x01` ever appear in retail Xbox wavebank data,
  or is XMA2 always encoded as codec `0x05`? Settle at the same corpus sweep.
- Streamed Xbox wavebanks (header `+0x0A = 1`, with a `.pws` name field): not
  observed in block 3187, which is 100% embedded. The streamed layout on Xbox
  is unmeasured here.
- The pre-first-blob padding region (abs `0x1460..0x19DC`, 0x57C bytes of zero
  between the end of the records table and the first blob) is larger than the
  PC's `align16(records_end)` requirement would predict (0x1460 is already
  16-aligned). Hypothesis: Xbox requires 2048-byte alignment for XMA2 packet
  streams, so the first blob starts at the next 2048-boundary past the records
  table (`align2048(0x1460) = 0x1800` from body-origin `0x1DC` → absolute
  `0x19DC`). PROVEN by inspection: `0x19DC - 0x1DC = 0x1800` which is
  `0x1800`-aligned. All inter-blob transitions are 2048-aligned (each `data_size`
  is a multiple of 2048).
