# ASET chunk — row layout (Mercenaries 2 `vz.wad`)

**Date:** 2026-05-18 · **field decode corrected 2026-07-21**  
**Status:** **Fully verified** — all four fields decoded. `u32_0` = asset name hash, `u32_2 >> 16` = block index confirmed by decompressing blocks and matching sub-entry headers.  

> **⚠ CORRECTION (2026-07-21).** The `+4` and `+8` low-half descriptions below were **wrong** for
> two months and were marked "Verified: Yes" the whole time, which is worse than having been
> absent. `secondary_ref` does not hold *dependency hashes*, and `packed_block_ref` low16 is not a
> *sub-entry offset*. **Both words hold BLOCK INDICES, and together they encode the asset's entire

**Decoder:** [`tools/aset_decoder.py`](../tools/aset_decoder.py) → [`output/block_dependency_graph.json`](../output/block_dependency_graph.json)  
**Tracer:** [`tools/aset_prop_tracer.py`](../tools/aset_prop_tracer.py) — traces asset hashes through ASET→PTHS

## Manifest facts (retail)

From [`output/extracted/ffcs_vz/manifest.json`](../output/extracted/ffcs_vz/manifest.json):

| Chunk | `meta` (row count) | `size` (bytes) | Bytes / row |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| ASET | 30,645 | 490,320 | **16** |

Demo `vz.wad` uses the same **16 bytes/row** (see [`docs/demo_corpus.md`](demo_corpus.md)).

## Row layout (little-endian)

Each row is four `uint32`:

| Offset | Field | Verified? | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| +0 | `asset_hash` | **Yes** | FNV-1a hash (with `\|0x20` case suppression and `^0x2A * prime` finalization) of the asset's internal name. Matches `name_hash` field in decompressed block sub-entry headers. **30,006 unique hashes** across 30,645 rows. Confirmed identical between Mercenaries 2 and The Saboteur. |
| +4 | `secondary_ref` | **Yes** (2026-07-21) | **Two block indices, not hashes.** `0xFFFFFFFF` = neither rung present. **High 16** = the `_P002` block index; **low 16** = the `_P003` block index (`0xFFFF` = absent). Measured: of model+texture rows, 8,449 name a `_P002` block and 5,537 name a `_P003` block — **100%** in the primary's own cell subtree, **0** out of range. |
| +8 | `packed_block_ref` | **Yes** | **High 16 bits** = block index into PTHS/INDX (verified: 3,581 unique blocks referenced) — the `_P000` resident rung. **Low 16 bits** = `0xFFFF` when there is no finer rung (19,847 rows), otherwise **the `_P001` block index** — *not* a sub-entry offset. Measured: 10,798 non-sentinel rows, **100%** naming a `_P001` block in the same cell subtree, exactly one LOD level finer, **0** out of range. |
| +12 | `type_id` | **Yes** | Type discriminator (0–35). Maps 1:1 to the `type_hash` field in decompressed block sub-entry headers. See type table below. |

## The LOD chain lives in the ASET row

A row does not name one block. It names **up to four**, one per LOD rung, packed into the two
u32s as `[hi16][lo16]` pairs:

| rung | field | half | sentinel |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_P000` (resident, coarsest) | `packed_block_ref` | hi16 | — always present |
| `_P001` | `packed_block_ref` | lo16 | `0xFFFF` |
| `_P002` | `secondary_ref` | hi16 | `0xFFFF` (whole word `0xFFFFFFFF` = neither) |
| `_P003` (finest) | `secondary_ref` | lo16 | `0xFFFF` |

Worked example — `ch_veh_tank_ztz98` (`0xF88147A1`):

```
packed_block_ref = 0x0DED14D7   ->  hi16 3565 = ch_veh_tank_ztz98_P000_Q3   (4,435 tri)
                                    lo16 5335 = ch_veh_tank_ztz98_P001_Q2  (18,333 tri)
secondary_ref    = 0x2093FFFF   ->  hi16 8339 = ch_veh_tank_ztz98_P002_Q1  (28,620 tri)
                                    lo16 0xFFFF = no _P003 rung
```

An independent geometry scan (`mercs2_probe --bin model_blocks`) finds chunks for that hash in
exactly blocks 3565, 5335 and 8339 — the three the row names, and no others.

**Why this matters for authoring.** "Is this asset safe to clone?" is **not** answered by the
primary block alone, and not by a single `sub` field either. An asset is genuinely single-block
only when **both** halves are sentinel:

```rust
let single_block = entry.packed_block_ref & 0xFFFF == 0xFFFF
                && entry.secondary_ref == 0xFFFF_FFFF;
```

Clone a multi-rung asset by copying only its `_P000` block and you ship the coarsest tier with no
finer rungs behind it. Use `AsetEntry::lod_chain()` (`mercs2_formats::ffcs`) rather than
re-deriving the packing.

### ⚠ The Xbox layout is MIRRORED — do not apply the PC decode to a 360 WAD

Everything above is measured on **PC** `vz.wad`. The 360 bake packs the same two block indices in
the **opposite half order**, so reasoning about an Xbox-side tool using the PC rule is invalid.
Same asset, `civ_hum_beachfemale_a` (`0xFA572E52`):

| | `packed_block_ref` | hi16 | lo16 |
|---|---|---|---|
| PC | `0x083E11EB` | 2110 → `c32143_P000_Q3` (**primary**) | 4587 → `c32143-c21152_P001_Q2` (`_P001`) |
| Xbox | `0x11E2083E` | 4578 → `c32143-c21152_P001_Q2` (`_P001`) | 2110 → `c32143_P000_Q3` (**primary**) |

Two further traps in the 360 file:

- **The ASET chunk is mixed-endian.** The container detects as `Big` and each `u16` block index
  reads correctly big-endian, but `type_id` comes back as `0x13000000` rather than `19` — it is
  stored little-endian. `ffcs::parse_aset_entries` applies one endianness to the whole row, so
  **30,552 of 30,553 Xbox rows decode with a nonsense `type_id`**. Any filter on `type_id == 19`
  silently matches nothing on a 360 WAD. (Consistent with the known "BE container is a MIX" rule.)
- Consequently, `mercs2_probe --bin aset_decode` prints a loud warning and refuses to interpret its
  own numbers when more than half the rows show `type_id > 64`. A measurement that silently returns
  zeros is worse than one that fails.

**Practical consequence.** `ucfx_byteswap::recompute_block_aset_subs` writes a physical entry-table
ordinal into the low half. Under the PC rule that would be plainly wrong — but it operates on
**Xbox** input, where that half is the primary block index and the converter's job is precisely to
re-lay the pair for PC. It was reported as a latent shipping bug; **that report is not supported by
evidence** and the function is unchanged pending a measurement of the Xbox semantics in their own
terms.

### What this corrects

- `secondary_ref` was documented as *"secondary block reference **hashes** for streaming
  dependencies"*. They are **block indices**, and they are this asset's own finer LOD rungs.
- `packed_block_ref` low16 was documented as *"a sub-entry offset within the block"*. It is a
  **block index**. Anything treating it as an intra-block ordinal is wrong — including
  `ucfx_byteswap::recompute_block_aset_subs`, which writes a physical entry ordinal into it, and
  the `max_sub >= entry_count` check in `tools/diagnose_patch_wad.py`, which validates against the
  wrong quantity entirely.
- The claim that `_P002`/`_P003` blocks are *never referenced from ASET* is false: 8,449 and 5,537
  rows name them respectively. They are simply named by the **other** word.

## Block distribution

ASET entries point to blocks by category:

| Category | ASET rows | % |
|----------|-----------|---|
| c3 cell (world geometry) | 15,324 | 50.0% |
| resident (always-loaded pack) | 7,018 | 22.9% |
| Vehicle blocks | 3,408 | 11.1% |
| Building / outpost blocks | 642 | 2.1% |
| Character blocks | 544 | 1.8% |
| vz_state overlays | 746 | 2.4% |
| resident2 (secondary pack) | 333 | 1.1% |
| Other | 2,630 | 8.6% |

### Where are the prop meshes?

Of the 3,007 mesh-type (type 19) ASET entries:
- **2,693 (89.6%)** are in c3 cell blocks
- **99** in resident2
- **82** in vehicle blocks
- **48** in building blocks
- **7** in the resident pack

Props like trees, rocks, fences, and street furniture are **embedded in c3 cell blocks**, not in standalone blocks. Each c3 cell contains all meshes + textures needed for that spatial region.

## Asset name hash opacity

The `asset_hash` values are FNV-1a hashes (with `|0x20` case suppression and `^0x2A * prime` finalization) of internal asset names. These names are **not stored** anywhere in the WAD — only the hash survives. The original asset names were defined during Pandemic's build pipeline. Entity names from placement data (e.g., `_global_env_rocksbeach01`) are **instance names**, not asset names, and do not hash to ASET entries.

The hash algorithm is identical to The Saboteur's, confirming shared Zero Engine lineage (Mercenaries 1 → Mercenaries 2 → The Saboteur). Implementation: `tools/pandemic_hash.py`.

To reverse-map hashes → names would require the game's internal registry tables or brute-force hash collision with a comprehensive wordlist.

## Verification method

Confirmed by decompressing the `resident_P000_Q3.block` (demo WAD, block index 1250):
1. Block header contains `count(4) + count × entry(16)` with `(name_hash, type_hash, field_c, chunk_size)` per entry
2. All 2,331 `name_hash` values from the block appear in ASET `u32_0`
3. All corresponding ASET rows have `u32_2 >> 16 = 1250` (correct block index)
4. `type_hash` in block headers maps 1:1 to ASET `u32_3` type discriminator
